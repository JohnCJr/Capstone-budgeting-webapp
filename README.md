# SavvyStudents

## Description

This is a website designed using the Agile method. It functions a a simple budgeting website that is catered towards college students. The Cajoe Bits logo was designed by Cassandra Jean, a group memeber of this project. All other images used were royalty-free and provided by https://pixabay.com/. Given the NoSQL nature of Firebase and the features available in the free version, the data populating the database and the rules are saved as JSON code. The free version doesn't provide tools to create procs, views or stored procedures. The firebase_data.JSON file contains the data that populates the "tables" in Firebase and the firebase.JSON file contains the rules used for the Firebase "tables". Passwords are securely stored elsewhere in Firebase, as opposed to being placed within a "table". Firebase abstracts the process of securely storing and hashing passwords.
